# Proj_13_Convolutional_NN_Fashion_Dataset

# Project Introduction

This project is "Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Fashion Dataset," in which a machine learning model is built to identify fashion items. CNN is used here so that fashion images can be classified accurately.

## Purpose

The main purpose of this project is to identify images from a fashion dataset (like shirt, pants, shoes, etc.) and classify them into the correct category. This model is a good example for those learning machine learning and deep learning.

## Features

- **Dataset:** Fashion MNIST is used, which contains images of 10 classes.
- **Model:** Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is used for accurate image recognition.
- **Training:** The model is trained and its performance is evaluated.
- **Visualization:** Results are visualized using graphs and images.

## How to Use

**Download the code:** First, clone or download this repository to your system.
   
   git clone https://github.com/raushanali/Proj_13_Convolutional_NN_Fashion_Dataset.git
  

**Install required libraries:** Install the libraries used in the project.
   
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   

**Run the model:** Run the main code file. For example:
   
   python cnn_fashion.py
   

 **View results:** You can see the training and testing results in the output, including accuracy and loss graphs.
